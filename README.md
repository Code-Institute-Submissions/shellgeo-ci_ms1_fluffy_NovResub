# The FitStop - A Milestone Project for the Code Institute Diploma in Software Development


### Introduction: Mischale 'Shell' George 

I have always wanted to learn how to code and my circumstances earlier this year led me to sign up to this course. I did this with the hopes of moving out my employment situation and to gain a better work-life balance.

This would be my first project that I am submitting for my Milestone project for the Code Institute. The inspiration for this project was mildy influenced by the assessment guide and my love for fitness. Over the years I have found myself in various fitness environments and this project gives me the oppurtunity to develop a hypothetical gym where everyone is truly welcome.
