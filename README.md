# **The FitStop**   
A Milestone Project completed by Shell George for the Code Institute Diploma in Software Development.

### Introduction: Mischale 'Shell' George 

I have always wanted to learn how to code and my circumstances earlier this year led me to sign up to this course. I did this with the hopes of moving out my employment situation and to gain a better work-life balance.

This would be my very first project that I have completed, and I am submitting for my Milestone project for the Code Institute. The inspiration for this project was mildly influenced by the assessment guide and my love for fitness. Over the years I have found myself in various fitness environments and this project gives me the opportunity to develop a hypothetical gym where everyone is truly welcome.

# User Experience Design 
## **Strategy**  
### User Needs & Business Objectives: 

 **Focus:** The focus of this project was to make an informative and interactive design for the founder of the gym, Isla Carson. The founder wanted to ensure the website was inclusive, intuitive and simple to use. 

 **Definition:** The website was created so that the customers/users can stay up to date with the gym's events and training classes. The users would also be able to get a good first impression of the environment, the trainers and the coaches. Once they are able to have all the important information, they can choose to sign up and become a member of the gym. 

 **Value:** This website should entice customers to learn as much about the gym and the services as possible. Which in turn, would lead them to sign up for the membership. This allows the founder to increase her customer base and increase her revenue from this business.

## **Scope** 
### Functional Specification:
This section is split up into two separate segments for the Owner and the User.


**Owner Goals:**
 - Easily accessible site on any chosen device. (mobile and web versions)
 - Key information on the landing page.
 - Quick links that show prices and benefits of the different membership types. 
 - Pages to show the user what make this gym stand out from the others.
 - Hassle-free sign up form for memberships.

**User Goals:**

First time user - 
 - Find out more information about the gym and its facilities
 - Be able to see all the available classes and see if they cater for their level of abilities
 - Be able to quickly access the social media links to see if other users have had a good experience.  
 - Find out the benefits of becoming member and weigh the pros & cons of being a single pass user or monthly paid member.
 - Find out more information about the coaches and trainers that work at the gym.


Regular or returning user - 
 - Have access to an easily readable timetable for all the classes.
 - Quick access to sign up link if they are a returning customer. 
 - Quickly access the social media links to follow the gym's activities and community events.
 - Learn about the additional benefits of being a monthly paid member and the different membership tiers. 

## **Structure** 
### **Interaction Design**:
Developers that came before me have already set some of the common conventions that we see for web development. My intention was to ensure that this convention was followed so that the user found the website easy to navigate.

This was done by keeping the colors and theme consistent across all pages. The labels for each page were kept consistent so that the user would be able to easily move through the site without getting lost. 

For example: 

1. The navigation bar on the website is laid out horizontally on the desktop version but on mobile I chose a vertical drop down. This was because many users would expect this usability as most websites have adopted a similar format. This makes the website intuitive to a new and returning user.  
2. The 'Sign-up' button will be designed to say 'Submitted' to show that the form has been completed. This gives the user visual feedback and confirmation that the action has been completed. 

### **Information Architecture**: 
The information in each of the pages was laid out so that a user would be able to move through the different content with ease and learn information about the different services and facilities the gym offered. 


## **Skeleton** 
The whole purpose of this website was to show users important information regarding the gym, the events and the membership prices. The aim is make the user feel like that can seamlessly move across the website, find the information that is relevant to them. Ensuring that this information is laid out intuitively will allow the user to have a positive experience. 

I attempted to use progressive disclosure across each of the page so that it would entice the user to continue exploring through the website and interact with different elements. I also wanted to make sure that there were visual metaphors using representational icons that would allow the customer to link certain titles with every day images. Furthermore, I also aim to implement visual confirmation an action or task is completed on any of the forms or inquiry boxes. This would give the user a visual cue to confirm that their action has been processed by my website.

# **Wireframes**

I used Balsamiq to create some wireframes. My understanding of wireframes it allows me as the developer; to create a mock-up of the website and give the Owner a visual representation of what the website will look like. 

I have attached my [First Draft](https://github.com/shellgeo/ci_ms1_fluffy/blob/f7f2e7769be8062332c6470cf8b4a08e1a4289f1/docs/docs/wireframes/first_draft.png) as this was my initial vision for the website and after some research I decided to elaborate on my design which is shown below.
