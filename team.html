                                have been training for
                                6 year and coaching for 3 years now.
                                When I started to first train I found it so much fun, and it taught me so much.
                                I also learned that the experience I had wasn't the same for everyone around me.
                                There was a
                                variety of reasons for this and my hope is that my clients and friends never have to
                                face
                                these barriers or obstacles, that would prevent them from loving their training.</p>
