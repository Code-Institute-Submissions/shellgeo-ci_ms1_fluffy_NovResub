                        gyms.
                        In my time in this industry I have had time to make note of what some gyms did well and what
                        others
                        haven't. My goal is to ensure that everyone has the best experience when they are with us. So

                        say hello, and we will see how we can make that happen together.</p>

                        have been training for 6 year and coaching for 3 years now.
                        When I started to first train I found it so much fun, and it taught me so much. I also learned
                        that
                        the experience I had wasn't the same for everyone around me.
                        There was a variety of reasons for this and my hope is that my clients and friends never have to
                        face these barriers or obstacles, that would prevent them from loving their training.</p>

                        I first got into CrossFit around 6 years and absolutely fell in love with this mode of
                        training. I knew then that I wanted share my love and passion for this sport with
                        everyone and decided to get accredited.
                        My goal is to make everyone fall in love with CrossFit and not make going to the gym a
                        chore.</p>

                        I love the technicality and the versatility of Olympic lifting. It can be trained for as
                        a sport on it own or the movements can be incorporated into training programs to develop
                        strength.
                        Feel free to sign up to one of my fundamentals classes, and we can get you to start
                        lifting in a safe and fun manner.</p>
