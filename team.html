                            <p>I have worked in the fitness industry for 20+ years and have managed several gyms.
                                In my time in this industry I have had time to make note of what some gyms did well and what others haven't. My goal is to ensure that everyone has the best experience when they are with us.
                                So come say hello, and we will see how we can make that happen together.

                        <p> Hi! I am a level 3 Personal Trainer and a Specialist Pilates Coach. I have been training for 6 year and coaching for 3 years now.
                            When I started to first train I found it so much fun, and it taught me so much.
                            I also learned that the experience I had wasn't the same for everyone around me. There was a variety of reasons for this and my hope is that my clients and friends never have to face these barriers or obstacles, that would prevent them from loving their training.

                                I first got into CrossFit around 6 years and absolutely fell in love with this mode of training. I knew then that I wanted share my love and passion for this sport with everyone and decided to get accredited.
